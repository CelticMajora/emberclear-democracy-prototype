# The Emberclear Democracy Prototype Discord Bot
Created to test out democracy rules and determine voting, state maintenance, and channel algorithms for emberclear.io

## Running the bot
From the home directory:
```
node src/server.js
```

## Bot commands
This readme may not always be up to date on available commands. All commands will be interpreted using src/endpoint.js.

For members, mention them using @user (e.g.: @GreenMobius).
For channels, just provide the channel name (no spaces).

Channels and channel administrator memberships are represented using Discord roles. You are able to configure these roles on your server by applying viewership permissions for text or voice channels to the target roles. Currently, channel admins have no additional power.
